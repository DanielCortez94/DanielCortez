# A little of me:
Junior Data Analyst and Graduate in Administration and International Business. I am passionate about technologies and data, I always find myself experimenting with different tools and trying to expand my knowledge to apply them to real problems.

I am currently learning and working on independent projects on GitHub, which may be useful to other users and to me.
